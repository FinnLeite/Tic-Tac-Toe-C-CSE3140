This is my first time using C++ so there were a few difficulties I ran into while making this tic tac toe game. 
The first obstacle was I did not have the required compiler installed. 
It was unknown to me that I needed to install a compiler and add tha path in the system environment variables because C# programs are able to run inside of visual studio code without this.
The second obstacle I had when making the game was the video tutorial I was watching failed to explain a lot of the errors he had at the end of the video so I had to find a different video to base my game off of.
Throughout all of these challenges, I was able to make a working Tic Tac Toe game within Visual Studio Code using the C++ library.
